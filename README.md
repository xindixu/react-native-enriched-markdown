- 🎯 High-performance Markdown parsing with [md4c](https://github.com/mity/md4c)
- 📐 CommonMark standard compliant
- 📊 GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)
- 🧮 LaTeX math rendering (block `$$...$$` with `flavor="github"`, inline `$...$` in all flavors)
- 🔀 [Markdown Streaming](docs/MARKDOWN_STREAMING.md) support (via [react-native-streamdown](https://github.com/software-mansion-labs/react-native-streamdown))
- 🎨 Fully customizable styles for all elements
- ✨ Text selection and copy support
- 📌 Custom text selection context menu items
- 🔗 Interactive link handling
- 🙈 Spoiler text with animated particle overlay and tap-to-reveal
- 🖼️ Native image interactions (iOS: Copy, Save to Camera Roll)

## Prerequisites

**Native (iOS / Android / macOS)**

- Requires [the React Native New Architecture (Fabric)](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/landing-page)
- Supported React Native releases: `0.81`, `0.82`, `0.83`, and `0.84`
- macOS support via [react-native-macos](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos) `0.81+`

**Web**

- Requires [`react-native-web`](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/) and Metro (or another bundler with `.web.tsx` platform resolution)
- No New Architecture requirement — the web renderer runs entirely in JavaScript via WebAssembly
- Only `EnrichedMarkdownText` is supported on web (`EnrichedMarkdownTextInput` is native-only)
- LaTeX math requires the optional [`katex`](https://katex.org/) peer dependency

## Installation

### Web

No steps beyond having `react-native-web` configured. For LaTeX math, install the optional peer dependency:

```sh
npm install katex
# or
yarn add katex
```

See [Web Support](docs/WEB.md) for full setup details, supported features, and prop behaviour.

### Bare React Native app (iOS / Android)

#### 1. Install the library

```sh
yarn add react-native-enriched-markdown
```

> [!TIP]
> To try the latest features before they land in a stable release, install the nightly build:
>
> ```sh
> yarn add react-native-enriched-markdown@nightly
> ```
>
> Nightly versions are published to npm automatically and may contain breaking changes.

#### 2. Install iOS / macOS dependencies

The library includes native code so you will need to re-build the native app.

```sh
# iOS
cd ios && bundle install && bundle exec pod install

# macOS (react-native-macos)
cd macos && bundle install && bundle exec pod install
```

### Expo app

#### 1. Install the library

```sh
npx expo install react-native-enriched-markdown
```

#### 2. Run prebuild

The library includes native code so you will need to re-build the native app.

```sh
npx expo prebuild
```

> [!NOTE]
> The library won't work in Expo Go as it needs native changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **iOS: Save to Camera Roll**
>
> If your Markdown content includes images and you want users to save them to their photo library, add the following to your `Info.plist`:
>
> ```xml
> <key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
> <string>This app needs access to your photo library to save images.</string>
> ```
